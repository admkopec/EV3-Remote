# ðŸ¤– EV3 Remote
An iOS app written in Swift acting as a "remote" for Lego EV3 Robots. I made this app back in 2018 as a High School assignment. It uses the [EV3 SDK](https://github.com/andiikaa/ev3ios.git) for communicating with the Lego robots over bluetooth.

### ðŸ”¨ Usage
Feel free to use this app as a template or an example for your own EV3 builds.

### ðŸ“œ Some Context
I created this app to supplement a robot made for a robots' competition. This app was used during the early stages of development as a "debugger" of my code.


P.S. I also had a more advanced version of the app but can't really find it right now. Maybe I'll post it when I do come across it.
